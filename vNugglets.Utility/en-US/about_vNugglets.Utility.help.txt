SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Module encapsulating vNugglets.com functions and code snippets

LONG DESCRIPTION
    A module that centralizes the functions and code snippets from vNugglets.com
    into a cohesive toolset.

    The cmdlets in this module focus largely (almost exclusively) on VMware
    virtual infrastructure.  Some of the areas of focus are:
      - VIRole management (copying/duplicating)
      - Finding VMs in inventory by attributes other than "name", like by the
          guest IP address, by the RDMs it may have, by the virtual portgroup to
          which it is connected
      - Mining VMHost information, like host and peripheral firmware
          information, HBA WWNs, logical drive information, information about
          "broken" vmnics
      - Establishing VM network to virtual portgroup physical uplink
          relationship information (which of the active uplinks is VM0 actually
          currently using?)
      - Mining VM information, like standard and RDM disks, EVC setting
      - vCenter connection information (in title of PowerShell window)
      - Datastore evacuation, template evacuation from VMHosts
      - Mining virtual portgroup information (cluster-locations)

EXAMPLES
    All of the cmdlets in this module have proper comment-based help.  Discover
    and learn via the standard PowerShell way:

        Get-Help -Full <cmdlet-name>
