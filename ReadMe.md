# vNugglets PowerShell Module
This is the PowerShell module created from the  nugglets from [vNugglets.com](http://vNugglets.com).  This repo is meant to be a place where the vNugglets.com code can reside, separate from the blog, for easier/central consumption and collaboration.

The cmdlets in this module all have proper help, so you can learn and discover just as you would and do with any other legitimate PowerShell module.

A few notes on updates to this repo:

Nov 2016
- started whole hog on creating PowerShell module to try to contain all of this goodness

Sep 2016
